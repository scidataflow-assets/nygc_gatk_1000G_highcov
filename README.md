                  resource of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data consented for
                  public distribution without access or use restrictions. The
                  final, phase 3 release of the 1kGP included 2,504 unrelated
                  samples from 26 populations and was based primarily on
                  low-coverage WGS. Here, we present a high-coverage 3,202-sample
                  WGS 1kGP resource, which now includes 602 complete trios,
                  sequenced to a depth of 30X using Illumina. We performed
                  single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and short insertion and deletion
                  (INDEL) discovery and generated a comprehensive set of structural
                  variants (SVs) by integrating multiple analytic methods through a
                  machine learning model. We show gains in sensitivity and
                  precision of variant calls compared to phase 3, especially among
                  rare SNVs as well as INDELs and SVs spanning frequency spectrum.
                  We also generated an improved reference imputation panel, making
                  variants discovered here accessible for association studies.",

## Asset Creation Details

This SciDataFlow Asset was created by mapping the 1000 Genomes manifest to a
SciDataFlow data manifest. This was down programmatically; see
`.scidataflow/Makefile` and `.scidataflow/map_manifest.py` for more details.
Note that the ordinary user will not need to use these scripts; simply use `sdf
pull --all` to retrieve the data.
